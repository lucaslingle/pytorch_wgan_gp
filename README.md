# pytorch_wgan_gp

This is a Pytorch implementation of the WGAN-GP ResNet model for CIFAR-10, from Gulrajani et al., 2017 - 'Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs'.

The implementation is working. It would require about 70 days to run on my local machine. To train it on an NVIDIA V100 GPU requires about 23 hours,
and the total cost would be approximately $42.
