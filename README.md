# pytorch_wgan_gp

This is a Pytorch implementation of the WGAN-GP ResNet model for CIFAR-10, from Gulrajani et al., 2017 - 'Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs'.
The implementation seems to be working, but it will require about 97 days to run on my local machine. If I train it on a GPU, I will update the readme 
with an approximate duration and cost for doing so.
